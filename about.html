            <h2>Built to simplify complex real estate decisions</h2>

            <p>
              Western Reserve Real Estate was created to solve a problem most buyers, sellers, and investors eventually encounter:
              real estate decisions rarely live in a single lane.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pricing affects financing. Financing affects offer strength. Condition affects inspections, insurance, and long-term ownership costs.
              Property management decisions affect value, cash flow, and exit timing. Yet most people are forced to navigate these
              interconnected decisions through disconnected professionals who rarely communicate with one another.
            </p>

            <p>
              WRRE exists to change that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than operating as a single-transaction brokerage, Western Reserve Real Estate is intentionally structured as a
              <strong>one-stop real estate platform</strong> — designed to support clients through acquisition, ownership, optimization,
              and long-term strategy.
            </p>

            <hr class="sep" />

            <h2>The WRRE ecosystem</h2>

            <p>
              At its core, WRRE is built around integration. Clients gain access to coordinated expertise across:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Residential buying and selling</li>
              <li>Investment property strategy</li>
              <li>Roofing and exterior evaluation</li>
              <li>Property management coordination</li>
              <li>Mortgage and financing solutions</li>
              <li>Long-term portfolio planning and exit strategy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This ecosystem allows decisions to be made <strong>with context</strong>, not in isolation.
              Instead of reacting to problems as they arise, we focus on anticipating them early — reducing friction,
              surprises, and costly missteps.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal is simple: fewer handoffs, clearer communication, and better outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2>About Alex Shahidian</h2>

            <p>
              I’m Alex Shahidian, Principal Broker of Western Reserve Real Estate, based in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the course of my career, I’ve completed approximately <strong>350 real estate transactions</strong>
              across a wide range of price points, property types, and market conditions throughout Northeast Ohio.
              That experience matters — not as a résumé line, but because volume builds pattern recognition.
            </p>

            <div class="card" style="border-left:6px solid rgba(12,37,4,.35); padding:16px; margin:16px 0;">
              <strong>After enough deals, you stop reacting and start anticipating:</strong>
              <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
                <li>Which homes will struggle during inspection</li>
                <li>Which pricing strategies create leverage versus stagnation</li>
                <li>Which financing structures actually win competitive offers</li>
                <li>Which “minor” issues quietly turn into major costs later</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              Clients describe the experience as calm, organized, direct, and transparent.
              No sales theatrics. Clear timelines. Honest trade-offs.
            </p>

            <hr class="sep" />

            <h2>Based in Chagrin Falls. Focused on Northeast Ohio.</h2>

            <p>
              Local knowledge matters — not just of neighborhoods, but of market behavior, inspection trends,
              and buyer psychology that never shows up on a listing sheet.
            </p>

            <p>
              That local focus, combined with a systems-driven approach, is what defines WRRE.
            </p>
